`2016-2019`
__iOS Developer__, Distillery LLC


_Head of iOS department_\\
In February 2018 I took the role of the head of iOS department. My main goal in this role is to shape our department to be more like a team and to help people with professional growth. Things that I did in this role: introduced a performance review process, organized weekly meetups in the department, established a 1-on-1 meetings practice.

_Project: Tri Star_\\
Tri Star Sports and Entertainment Group is a single-source business management firm that provides personal Chief Financial Officer services. 
This project is an internal tool for Tri Star company, that includes chats, task manager and calendar. Here I had some hands-on experience with TDD, MVVM and reactive programming. The project has quite a lot of intricate relationships between entities and rather complex business logic, so the decision to write unit tests was really beneficial.

_Project: SoapBox_\\
SoapBox is a social platform built around ephemeral broadcasts, but with important demographics attached to each user’s post that allow for them to survive virally through a simple sharing mechanism. 
I joined the project a few months before its release, I was a team leader for that time. I was able to solve a couple of pain points of the project, and also worked with a few things that were new to me, such as Apple Pay. Apart from writing code my responsibilities were code review, managing release process and making builds for QA team and client.


`2012-2016`
__iOS Developer__, ZAO BCC


_Project: FrontStage_\\
MediaStage - carrier-class solution for implementing interactive television projects at any access networks and for all types of subscriber devices. FrontStage part of the project is a set of client applications for different platforms, that provide a unified experience and convenient access to interactive video services. 
I was working on iOS and tvOS apps for this project, which is highly customisable and can be easily tailored for different customers. It has lots of custom UI elements, which were quite a challenge to implement. I learned a lot about HLS and iOS player frameworks, worked with In-App Purchases, developed architecture for rather complex business logic, non-standard navigation and model layer, that needs to be updated from Push Notifications and/or WebSockets.
